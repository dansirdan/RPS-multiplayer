# RPS-multiplayer

deployed at:

Hard Homework option:

- Only two users can play at the same time.
- Accomplished through usage of local and firebase data storage.

- Both players pick either `rock`, `paper` or `scissors`. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

- Each result displays a different Gif image as well.

- Each player can only see their screen through use of hide() and show().

- The game tracks each player's wins and losses.

- Chat feature includes, username: "message".
- Chat box deletes when both users close or refresh their window.

- Styling based off the main gif image of the RPS hands in black & white.

FUTURE PLANS:
- Use this as the base to create a battle royale RPS game. We're learning node so maybe!?
